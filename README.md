## Overview
This project involves implementing the classic Pepse game in Java, as part of an exercise for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course.

- **Player Controls:** Use the arrow keys to run and the space button to jump.
- **Energy Management:** The avatar's energy decreases with movement and can be replenished by resting or eating fruits.
- **Environment:** Includes trees with leaves, fruits, and trunks.
- **Dynamic Elements:**
  - A sun that moves in a circular path, dynamically changing the screen brightness.
  - A sky background.
- **Boundaries:** Ensure the avatar does not go beyond screen bounds to avoid losing the game.
